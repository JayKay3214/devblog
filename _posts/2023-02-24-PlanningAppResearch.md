# Planning The Game

As a team we started with a couple different steps when we planned out how to start making the website.

#### Familiarization With Using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/recent?fuid=1213707683867090178)

We spent some time to familiarize ourselves with the tools that we were using and what we could do with them and their specific functions.

- We looked at and experimented with the shape tools that could be used in Figma

- We looked at the assets and selection tools and looked at how we could select different shapes that we had made.

- We looked at the design tools that helped us modify our shapes to the correct color and sizes along with border thickness and etc.

#### Finding an Idea For The Game

Ultimately we came up with two ideas and regarding what game we would like to make and had made some cursory plans regarding what to do. We ultimately decided to make a block puzzle game.

- The planning for the ideas

#### Putting Together The Rules Of The Game

We looked over different aspects of the game that we could do and came up with several ideas, several of which we cut out due to lack of time. We decided on a list of icons and settings that we would like to put in our game.

#### Planning The IA

For part of our training we went over how to plan an `Information Architecture` or `IA` this what its called when we give our app structure.

We practiced making an IA using other apps to reference.

#### Putting Together An Idea Of What The User Interface Is Going To Look Like.

When making the `User Interface` we tried making a basic format for what the game would look like and where all the aspects that we decided on when making our rules. These are things such as **undo buttons, a bar that states how many turns the player has, the settings button, and etc**.

#### Planning The Tutorial

The criteria for our Tutorial was that we needed to explain how to play the game in the most effective number of steps for the players enjoyment and patience. This led to another planning sessions where we brought up different ideas on what we would explain and how long of an explanation we would need.

#### Going Over The App Icon

When making the game we tried our hands at making an `app icon` that we could use when labeling our game.

#### The Final UI

The game has finally come together.
